                                <p>
                                    One day I was walking in the woods with my dog and came across a pile of trash
                                    thrown off to the side of the trail. I immediately shifted my mode into reductionist
                                    mode, thinking, “What kind of monster would do such a thing? If only there was a way
                                    to get rid of people like this.” But then something turned the mirror back onto
                                    myself. “Perhaps the better question is: What is the deeper malady of a hurting
                                    life, hurting life? What kind of world have we created and grown up in that compels
                                    us to be the abuser in a relationship? What lack of community teaches us to ignore
                                    the community around us? What profane world have we developed, that no longer
                                    recognizes sacredness in all its forms?”
                                </p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    <p>
                                        "Engrave this upon my heart: There isn’t anyone you couldn’t love once you’ve
                                        heard their story."
                                    </p>

                                    There is no finger with which I can point. I am that kind of person that throws
                                    trash off the side of the trail. I have lived the life I’m paid to live, buying
                                    things and
                                    throwing them away, off to the side of the trail. I am the one driving cars, paying
                                    for gas, oil, and tires, then throwing them away, off to the side of the trail. I am
                                    the one that buys zucchini wrapped in plastic, soap in plastic, plastic in plastic
                                    with more plastic, and then throwing them away, off to the side of the trail. I was
                                    born into this world, have assimilated to it, and become acculturated to it. In
                                    almost all aspects of life, I am the destroyer of worlds, I am a part of the mess,
                                    compelled and even obligated to play this part.
                                </p>

                                    But why? Why would anybody really do this? It often feels as if there is something
                                    of great value that we have forgotten about, as if we were a species with amnesia.
                                    Perhaps we choose to forget,
                                    perhaps we wanted to go on a journey, to be surprised, to play without knowing the
                                    outcome. Perhaps we needed to feel the weight of disconnection, so that we could
                                    truly know
                                    connection. Perhaps.

                                    There is some kind of knowing that whispers, "Everything and everyone are exactly

                                    judgment, back into the renuion of connection. I no longer have the illusions that
                                    picking up trash will save the earth, that it will even make the slightest bit

                                    stop the process of destruction. I pick up trash, that which has been carelessly

                                    What does this have to do with the Sunchoke? Spend time with any plant and you will
                                    often get the questions that you didn’t know you needed to ask. Sunchoke is often
                                    called
                                    Jerusalem Artichoke, and it is not from Jerusalem and it is not a type of artichoke,
                                    but nevertheless it is a fascinating plant from the Sunflower family. Whether found
                                    in some of the worst soils, it grows. When encountering some of the harshest
                                    conditions, it still grows. And even when it finds itself in the shade, it seems to
                                    grow faster, searching for even more light. It grows with vigor wherever and almost
                                    in whatever situation it finds itself.

                                    Disruption for the Sunchoke, is merely a new opportunity for growth. So if you want
                                    more Sunchokes dig them up to eat them, you will give the tubers that are left in
                                    the ground new vigor. Which makes the Sunchoke, not only a great teacher, but also a
                                    great addition to a Perma Farms.

                                        The roots are the edible part of this plant, and they are prolific, which makes
                                        harvesting them a breeze. We harvest ours after the first frost and throughout
                                        winter, as they develop a nice sweetness after a good frost has knocked down the
                                        tops.

                                        The tubers have very subtle hints of a nuttier and sweeter potato. They do not
                                        taste bad, but they do require that the eater not think that they will taste
                                        like a potato, because they really are different from potatoes, full of inulin
                                        as opposed to starch. This is the very reason they are often considered a
                                        healthy alternative for those with diabetes. It is important to note that inulin
                                        can also be the source of some serious flatulence. So beware.

                                        There are many uses for Sunchoke, as they have been made into wine and liquor,
                                        roasted and used as a coffee substitute, and processed down to make a sweetener.
                                        Mostly we use them in similar ways that we would potatoes, with a couple of
                                        exceptions; 1. If you cook them too much they turn into mush, and 2. they can be
                                        eaten raw, and go great when sliced and put in a salad.
