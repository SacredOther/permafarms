                                <h3>The Earth Tree</h3>
                                <p>
                                    A dreamer once dreamt of the earth as a tree - it was not the only tree. The earth
                                    tree started out small like a seed. Over time it started to spiral up, adding
                                    complex, interwoven layers to itself. There were mineral layers, layers of
                                    microorganisms, plant layers, animal layers, and human layers. Many more
                                    unexplainable things were above and below and many more things in-between. The
                                    layers created many branches, and each branch contained a multitude of leaves. These
                                    leaves upon further inspection appeared to the dreamer as leaves covered with a
                                    multitude of eyes.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The tree seemed as if it existed to experience light, as its many branches moved and
                                    grew to wherever it could better touch this light. And every branch of this light
                                    reaching tree appeared connected. There were no ‘I’ branches, just a collective of
                                    ‘We’ branches. As the history of this tree passed before the dreamer’s eye, some
                                    smaller branches grew into areas that had no light. These branches would eventually
                                    die off and the tree’s energy would be diverted to branches that were bathing in the
                                    light. Broken branches appeared to be teaching the tree what didn’t work and what
                                    wasn’t beautiful.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    During the dream, the dreamer noticed that on this particular earth tree, there
                                    happened to be a large branch that was broken. This branch was still connected to
                                    the tree but appeared be weighing heavily on the tree. The dreamer asked the dream,
                                    “What does this branch represent?” To which the dream responded, “This is the branch
                                    of a disconnected civilization. Part of the We has forgotten its purpose. It has
                                    grown into a dark place and is now inviting many diseases. The dreamer asked, "Why
                                    don't you just cut the branch off?" To which the dream responded, "It does not work
                                    like that. It must happen in its own time, and if it falls off in time, it will
                                    nourish the tree from below. If it does not fall off in time, it can infect the
                                    whole tree.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The dreamer then examined this branch more closely and found withering leaves that
                                    had completely lost contact with the light. They were sick and their eyes were pale,
                                    having been by screens, noise, money, work, medication, agriculture, control, and
                                    isolation. Each eye represented a human, and these particular humans received their
                                    nourishment from only this broken branch. Upon examining the food of this branch,
                                    the dreamer heard its faint warning, “Food from a broken branch will only make you
                                    forget.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Sickness was everywhere on this branch. There were mountains that had been razed,
                                    forest that were stripped to fields, animals in cages, insects that were seen as
                                    enemies, and a glowing sun that was now seen as harmful to human skin. The dreamer
                                    asked the dream, "Why would we do this?" To which the dream responded, “To light a
                                    candle is to cast a shadow. This is the price we must pay in searching for more
                                    light. Sometimes trees don’t make it, sometimes the process fails… and sometimes We
                                    remember. Help Us remember.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Upon awakening the dreamer went to the wilderness alone, and started to remember.
                                </p>

                                        One plant that needs to be remembered is the wild and untamed Hickory tree. In
                                        the early fall the ground will start to fill with tennis ball like husks of
                                        brown and green. These will form cracks and fissures along the edge that when
                                        opened up will reveal a hard kernel. Easily opened with a good quality nut
                                        cracker, these contain the nutmeat, a delicious and nutritious pecan like nut
                                        that in my opinion out surpasses anything found in a supermarket.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There are lots of different types of hickory; there is Shellbark, Shagbark,
                                        Bitternut, Pignut, Mockernut… Some nuts are amazing, while others are quite
                                        bitter. The Shellbark and Shagbark are said to be the best tasting. We often
                                        sample a nut before we start collecting the husks and kernels, making sure it is
                                        not bitter. Each tree varies, and some nuts are just ok, while others are
                                        incredible.

                                        We like to harvest the nuts right away. If left to sit, we often find that
                                        little nut weevils will have worked their way through a lot of the kernels.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Hickory trees don’t always produce tons of fruit evey year, as they usually take
                                        a year or two off, producing only small crops in the down years. But in a forest
                                        with plenty of trees, we have never found a shortage of nuts to gather.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Hickory nuts can be ground to make a flour, but we prefer to eat them just as
                                        they are.
